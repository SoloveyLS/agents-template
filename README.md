# Agents Template

This repository provides `AGENTS.template`, a starting point for future skills, workflows, and project rules. The template is intentionally minimal and expects a short kickoff discussion on initialization or a richly documented `README.md`/equivalent describing the project domain, code style, and constraints.

## Initialization Expectations

On `/init`, the template should be read and the `TODO` and `ISSUES` should be created as specified by `AGENTS.template`. The `TODO` paragraphs can be authored by both the user and the model.
